# CV Templates and Tailoring Guide

<!-- Candidate facts and reusable evidence live only in 01-candidate-profile.md. -->

## Template: Stock One-Page Resume

Use the single-column LaTeX layout in `cv/main_example.tex`. Read identity, contact
details, and factual evidence from `01-candidate-profile.md` at runtime; never store those
candidate facts in this method file. Preserve the
navy-and-blue visual hierarchy, compact Helvetica-style sans-serif typography, literal
contact-detail treatment, section rules, and ATS-safe reading order.

**Output file:** `cv/main_<company>_<role>.tex`
**Compile with:** **lualatex** on MiKTeX/TeX Live.
**Structural reference:** `cv/main_example.tex` (`01-candidate-profile.md` is the sole
factual baseline)

### Compile command

```bash
cd cv && lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode main_<company>_<role>.tex
```

Expected output: `Output written on main_<company>_<role>.pdf (1 page, ...)`. Any page count other than 1 is a failure that must be fixed before presenting to the user.

## Document Structure

Do not rebuild the layout from a generic template. Copy
`cv/main_example.tex`, then tailor only the summary, strength lines, and evidence bullets
while preserving the preamble and these macros:

- `\resumesection{...}` for uppercase section headings and horizontal rules
- `\roleheader{title}{ASCII date range}{employer}{location}` for experience
- `\projectheader{title}{scope label}` for projects
- `\schoolheader{institution}{location}` for education
- the compact `itemize` settings and single-column reading order

The font uses Latin Modern Sans because the visually similar TeX Gyre Heros build caused confirmed ATS extraction errors such as `ANAL YSIS`, `T ableau`, and `UA T`. Do not switch fonts without re-running the text-layer check.

### Spacing inside itemize lists (important)

**Do not place `\vspace{...}` between `\item` entries in an `itemize` list.** Even though the source looks symmetric, this pattern occasionally produces a noticeably oversized gap before a single item: the inter-item `\vspace` creates a paragraph break that interacts unpredictably with the list's internal `\itemsep`, so LaTeX renders one of the gaps wider than the rest. Remove the inter-item `\vspace` and let `itemize` use its native uniform spacing.

```latex
% WRONG - intermittently produces an oversized gap before one bullet
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Foo}: ...
\vspace{1pt}
\item \textbf{Bar}: ...
\vspace{1pt}
\item \textbf{Baz}: ...
\end{itemize}

% RIGHT - uniform spacing using the list's native itemsep
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Foo}: ...
\item \textbf{Bar}: ...
\item \textbf{Baz}: ...
\end{itemize}
```

Two related patterns are fine and should be kept:
- spacing inside the `\resumesection` macro, which separates the heading rule from its content
- small `\vspace` values between complete role or project blocks, after visual verification

### Section headings must match the CV's language (important)

Section headings are literal text baked into the template. Read the current CV language
from `01-candidate-profile.md` at runtime and keep headings/content consistent with it.

## Section-by-Section Tailoring

### Profile Statement / Elevator Pitch (Best Practice)
This is the most important section to customize. It appears immediately below the contact header.

Write a compact 3-5 line paragraph that functions as an "elevator pitch": a concise introduction explaining why you're qualified for *this specific role*. Focus on what the employer gains from hiring you.

When the role sits outside your home domain, **lead with the domain-transfer argument** - the one or two sentences connecting your background to their problem (e.g. wave physics to radar signal processing) belong in the profile statement's opening, not buried in the cover letter. It is the strongest card a domain-changer holds; play it first.

Build the statement at runtime from the task-relevant evidence in
`01-candidate-profile.md`. Do not persist role-specific candidate statements here and do
not use archived tailored drafts as evidence. A useful statement names the target function,
the strongest demonstrated evidence, and the truthful adjacency or development area in
3-5 lines.

### Core Competencies / Skills Section (Best Practice)
Reorder and emphasize based on the role. Use bold category labels.

Use three compact labeled lines, normally `Data & Analysis`, `Process & Systems`, and `Communication & Coordination`. Reorder or rename them only when the posting's language truthfully supports the change.

Use the posting's own core term in the matching bullet's bold label when it truthfully applies - ATS and skim-reading hiring managers match literally, and "MLOps" in a heading outperforms a paraphrase like "ML Deployment".

### Education
- Always include your highest degrees
- For senior roles, keep education brief (dates and titles only)
- Include thesis topics when relevant to the target role

#### In-progress qualifications must say so explicitly

**A bare year range is not enough.** An entry reading `2025–2026`, seen partway through 2026, looks like a *finished* degree, because a reader skimming a CV treats a closed range as closed. A profile statement that says "currently completing…" does not fix it: the education entry is where a reader checks the credential, so it has to stand on its own.

State completion inside the entry itself:

```latex
\schoolheader{[Institution]}{[Location]}
{\bfseries [Degree], [Field]} | [Start] - Expected [Month Year]
```

Any consistent form works: `In progress, expected <Month Year>.` / `Expected completion <Month Year>.` / a date field of `2025–present`.

Claiming a credential not yet held is a factual misstatement, and it is the kind discovered at transcript or reference check rather than at interview. It costs nothing to prevent. The same applies to in-progress certifications and courses.

**Check for agreement:** for a current student, the profile statement, the education entry, and any availability or work-permit note must all give the same completion date. Contradiction between them is worse than any single version.

### Professional Experience
- Rewrite bullet points to emphasize aspects most relevant to the target role
- Use 3-4 bullets for the most recent role and 1-2 for the previous role; every line must earn its space on the one-page resume
- **Emphasize measurable results** where possible: "Reduced processing time by X%", "Model adopted by the team"

#### Check tenure against visible output

Before finalizing, look at each role the way a stranger will: **date span versus how much work is shown.** A two-year role represented by a single project reads as low output, whether or not that is fair. The reader cannot know what filled the time, so they guess, and the guess is unflattering.

This bites hardest on **career changers** (part of the tenure went into learning the new field), on **long-cycle work** (industrial deployment, clinical or regulatory projects, research — one delivery genuinely takes quarters), and on anyone whose employer kept them on a single account or product.

Three honest fixes, in order of preference:

1. **Surface more real work.** Ask what else the period contained. There are often real secondary projects, internal tooling, or support work that never reached the CV because it felt minor. Best fix when the material exists.
2. **Make the phases within the role explicit.** If the span genuinely had stages, say so — an initial period learning the domain or supporting the team, then ownership of the named work through to delivery. A phased arc reads as a growth curve; an undifferentiated multi-year block reads as stagnation.
3. **Name what made the cycle long.** Data collection from a live environment, validation with domain experts, deployment and iteration against real output. Reviewers who know the domain accept this immediately.

**Never** pad with invented projects, and **never** quietly shorten the employment dates so the ratio looks better. Both are discoverable, and both are worse than the perception problem being solved.

**Prepare the interview answer too.** If a long span against little visible output survives these fixes, the question is coming. The candidate needs a ready two-part answer — what actually filled the time, and what the outcome was — recorded in their interview prep rather than improvised in the room.

### Handling Employment Gaps (Best Practice)
If there is a gap in your employment history:
- The gap should be explained matter-of-factly if needed
- Describe how professional development continued during the gap
- Frame as deliberate skill-building and career repositioning

### Publications
- Include Google Scholar link if applicable
- Select 3-4 most relevant publications (not always all of them)
- For non-academic roles, keep brief

### Evidence Links
Wherever the CV names a verifiable artifact - a public project, a hackathon entry, a publication - carry its link (`\href`) so a reader can verify the claim in one click. A CV whose strongest claims are checkable reads as more credible everywhere else too.

### Honors and Awards
- Keep format brief, one line each

### References
- Keep references off the one-page resume; the candidate can provide them upon request
- Do not attach reference letters unless an employer explicitly requests them

### LaTeX Special Characters (important)

Postings and profile data arrive as plain text; the CV is LaTeX. Escape these wherever they land in body text - company names, achievement bullets, skill lists:

| Character | Write | Typical trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `&` | `\&` | company names: Bang \& Olufsen, Brüel \& Kjær, H\&M |
| `%` | `\%` | quantified achievements: "cut latency by 40\%" |
| `$` | `\$` | salary and cost figures |
| `#` | `\#` | "ranked \#1", C\# |
| `_` | `\_` | file names, code identifiers |
| `~` | `\textasciitilde{}` | URLs, "approx. 5 years" tildes |
| `^` | `\textasciicircum{}` | version strings, math |

Two failure modes deserve special care:

- **`%` fails silently.** An unescaped `%` starts a LaTeX comment: the compile succeeds with zero errors, and everything after the `%` on that line vanishes from the PDF. `Cut inference latency by 40% and saved DKK 2M annually` renders as "Cut inference latency by 40" - the bullet keeps its impressive-looking fragment and loses the actual result. Quantified achievement bullets are exactly where the guidance steers you ("use numbers where possible"), so check every `%` in every bullet before compiling.
- **`&` fails loudly** in normal LaTeX text (alignment-tab errors, `Missing } inserted`). The compile loop catches it, but escape employer names up front rather than debugging the compile.

Related trap: a bullet whose text begins with a literal `[` must be braced - `\item {[text]}` - or LaTeX parses the bracketed text as `\item`'s optional label and renders it clipped off the left page edge with a clean compile. The example CV's placeholder bullets are braced for exactly this reason.

## Compile-and-Inspect Loop (MANDATORY)

This file owns the active CV template's build and repair procedure. The shared final
artifact checks live in `10-application-verification.md`; `/apply` decides when that
common checklist runs. Do not duplicate the common checklist here.

After writing the CV and before presenting to the user, always compile and visually inspect the PDF. Iterate until the layout is clean. Workflow:

1. Run `lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode main_<company>_<role>.tex`
2. Check the output page count: must be exactly 1
3. Render the PDF and visually inspect the full page
4. Confirm no heading, date, bullet, link, or final training line is clipped, crowded, or stranded

### Fixing common page-break problems

**Problem: a trailing section spills to page 2**
Cut or tighten the lowest-relevance content using the relevance-weighted rules below. Do not reduce the margins, font size, or line spacing below the verified values in `cv/main_example.tex`.

**Problem: the page feels too dense**
Remove duplicated phrases before changing typography. The section order and white space should remain close to the master resume.

**Problem: the page feels visibly sparse**
Restore the highest-relevance grounded bullet that was previously cut; do not add generic filler.

## ATS Parseability

Most employers run CVs through an ATS before a human sees them, and the ATS reads the PDF's embedded **text layer**, not the rendered page. A CV can pass visual inspection and still extract as garbage. After the layout passes the compile-and-inspect loop, verify the text layer:

```bash
python tools/verify_pdf.py cv/main_<company>_<role>.pdf --dump-text cv/main_<company>_<role>.txt
```

Extraction tries **pypdf** first (`pip install pypdf`, BSD license), then Poppler `pdftotext`. If a fallback still uses `pdftotext -layout`, it must also pass `-enc UTF-8`: Xpdf-based builds default to Latin-1, which makes every non-ASCII character in a perfectly good CV read back as a replacement character. If neither extractor is available, skip the mechanical check with a warning and rely on the visual PDF read for keyword coverage.

What to check in the extraction:

- **Contact details as literal text.** The email address and phone number must appear as printed text, not only as icons or hyperlink destinations.
- **No garbled or split keywords.** `(cid:NNN)`, `�`, or false word breaks such as `ANAL YSIS`, `T ableau`, and `UA T` are failures. Preserve the master resume's verified font configuration unless a replacement passes the same extraction check.
- **Reading order.** The stock resume is single-column, so extraction order should match visual order. Custom templates with sidebars or multi-column layouts can interleave unrelated lines; if extraction order is scrambled, the user is trading ATS compatibility for looks and should be told.
- **Keyword coverage.** Match the posting's required/preferred terms against the extracted text, in the posting's language. Prefer the posting's exact term over a synonym when it is truthfully applicable - ATS matching is often literal. Never add a keyword the profile does not support.

### Date fields must be ASCII ranges (confirmed ATS import failure)

This one is worth knowing about because it fails **silently**. A CV that passes every other check in this section - clean extraction, no `(cid:)` markers, contact details intact, correct reading order - can still have its dates dropped on import. In a real Workday resume import, a CV built from this template lost the end date of a short contract role and failed to import **any** education entry at all, forcing manual re-entry. Nothing about the PDF or its text layer looked wrong.

Two independent causes, both easy to avoid:

1. **`--` in a date renders as an en-dash (U+2013), not a hyphen.** LaTeX ligatures `--` (two ASCII hyphens, U+002D) into a single en-dash glyph, so `2016--2024` reaches the PDF text layer as `2016<U+2013>2024`. Many parsers split date ranges only on an ASCII hyphen and see no range at all. Write the date argument with a **single hyphen**:

   ```latex
   \roleheader{Role Title}{2016-2024}{Organization}{Location} % parses
   \roleheader{Role Title}{2016--2024}{Organization}{Location} % en-dash, may not
   ```

   This applies to the **date argument only**. Keep `--` everywhere it is typographically correct in prose, for example a numeric range like `EUR 600k--1M`.

2. **A bare single year gives the parser no end date.** A short contract, mandate or internship written only as `2016` imports as a start date with nothing to close it. Use an explicit range, with months where the role ran under a year:

   ```latex
   \roleheader{Contract Role}{Mar 2016 - Jul 2016}{Client}{Location}
   ```

   Where a genuine range exists, use it even when a single year would be factually accurate - a degree written `1995` is true but imports worse than `1992-1995`. Do not invent a start date you do not have; a lone graduation year is fine, just expect it to be typed in by hand.

**Add this to the step 5d checks**: after extracting the text layer, confirm every experience entry shows a start *and* an end separated by an ASCII hyphen. Because the failure is silent and invisible in the PDF, the candidate otherwise discovers it only while filling in the application form.

## Page Budget - Hard One-Page Limit

The CV **must** fit on exactly 1 page when compiled. Use these content limits as a guide:

| Section | Max budget |
|---------|-----------|
| Profile statement | 3-5 lines |
| Skills | 3 compact labeled lines |
| Most recent role | 3-4 bullets |
| Previous role | 1-2 bullets |
| Selected projects | 2-3 projects, 1-2 bullets each |
| Education | 2 entries plus only relevant coursework |
| Training | 1 compact line |
| References | Omit; available upon request |

**If in doubt, cut rather than squeeze.** Reducing `\vspace` or geometry scale to force-fit content makes the CV look cramped.

## Relevance-weighted cutting (the right way to shrink a CV)

**Cut by signal, not by section.** Static priority lists ("remove oldest education first, then shorten the earliest role...") are wrong when a relevant "lower-priority" item is competing with an irrelevant "higher-priority" item. An older-role bullet that speaks directly to the posting is worth more than a recent-role bullet that does not.

For every candidate line, score three things:

1. **Relevance to THIS posting** — does the line hit a named tool, keyword, or stated responsibility in the job ad?
2. **Uniqueness** — is it the only place this claim appears, or is it duplicated elsewhere in the CV?
3. **Narrative load** — does the cover letter depend on it? If cutting the line would force you to rewrite a cover-letter paragraph, it is load-bearing.

Cut the lowest-total-score line first, regardless of which section it sits in.

### Practical order of cuts (easiest → last resort)

1. **Redundancy.** If an achievement appears in both Core Competencies AND a role bullet, the Core Competencies version is usually the cleaner cut (the experience bullet is more concrete evidence).
2. **Profile-statement fluff.** A sentence that just restates what Publications or Skills will show. ("Peer-reviewed publications on X..." is already a Publications entry — profile can claim it once and stop.)
3. **Low-relevance experience bullets.** A bullet about work that does not touch posting keywords, wherever it sits. This cuts across sections before touching the structural list.
4. **Low-relevance supporting content.** An older-role bullet that does not speak to the target role. A certification that does not touch the posting's stack. A language entry that can be condensed to one line.
5. **Low-relevance publications.** Keep 1-2 publications that best match the posting. Cut the rest before touching experience bullets.
6. **Last-resort structural cuts.** Oldest education entry, tightening an older role to 2 bullets, collapsing Certifications into a single line. These only happen if the relevance-weighted cuts above have already been exhausted.

### Pitfalls to avoid

- Do not mechanically cut from the bottom of a static section list without checking relevance. "Cut the oldest role first" is wrong if that role is literally about the skill the posting asks for.
- Do not cut the one concrete example the cover letter leans on. Relevance is measured against the cover letter you wrote, not just the job posting — interviewers will have read both.
- For a near-miss overflow onto page 2, remove duplication or tighten the lowest-relevance line. Do not shrink below the master resume's verified typography and margins.

## Recommended Section Order

The section order varies by role type:

**For technical / data science / ML roles:**
1. Profile statement / elevator pitch
2. Core competencies / Skills
3. Professional Experience (reverse chronological)
4. Education (reverse chronological)
5. Languages
6. Publications & Awards
7. References

**For domain-specific / specialist roles:**
1. Profile statement / elevator pitch
2. Core competencies / Skills
3. Education (reverse chronological) - credentials are a key qualifier
4. Professional Experience (reverse chronological)
5. Publications & Awards
6. References
